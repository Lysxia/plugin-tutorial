(*
 * Utilities for dealing with Coq terms, to abstract away some pain for students
 * Utilities for the state monad were moved to stateutils.ml/stateutils.mli
 *)

(* --- Environments and definitions --- *)

(*
 * Environments in the Coq kernel map names (local and global variables)
 * to definitions and types. Here are a few utility functions for environments.
 *)
               
(*
 * This gets the global environment and the corresponding state:
 *)
let global_env () =
  let env = Global.env () in
  Evd.from_env env, env

(* Push a local binding to an environment *)
let push_local (n, t) env =
  EConstr.push_rel Context.Rel.Declaration.(LocalAssum (n, t)) env

(*
 * One of the coolest things about plugins is that you can use them
 * to define new terms. Here's a simplified (yes it looks terrifying,
 * but it really is simplified) function for defining new terms and storing them
 * in the global environment.
 *
 * This will only work if the term you produce
 * type checks in the end, so don't worry about accidentally proving False.
 * If you want to use the defined function later in your plugin, you
 * have to refresh the global environment by calling global_env () again,
 * but we don't need that in this plugin.
 *)
let define name body sigma =
  let udecl = UState.default_univ_decl in
  let scope = Locality.Global Locality.ImportDefaultBehavior in
  let kind = Decls.(IsDefinition Definition) in
  let cinfo = Declare.CInfo.make ~name ~typ:None () in
  let info = Declare.Info.make ~scope ~kind  ~udecl ~poly:false () in
  ignore (Declare.declare_definition ~info ~cinfo ~opaque:false ~body sigma)

(*
 * When you first start using a plugin, if you want to manipulate terms
 * in an interesting way, you need to move from the external representation
 * of terms to the internal representation of terms. This does that for you.
 *)
let internalize env trm sigma =
  Constrintern.interp_constr_evars env sigma trm

(* --- Equality --- *)
  
(*
 * This checks if there is any set of internal constraints in the state
 * such that trm1 and trm2 are definitionally equal in the current environment.
 *)
let equal env trm1 trm2 sigma =
  let opt = Reductionops.infer_conv env sigma trm1 trm2 in
  match opt with
  | Some sigma -> sigma, true
  | None -> sigma, false

(* --- Reduction --- *)

(*
 * Infer the type, then reduce/simplify the result
 *)
let reduce_type env trm sigma =
  let sigma, typ = Typing.type_of ~refresh:true env sigma trm in
  sigma, Reductionops.nf_betaiotazeta env sigma typ
